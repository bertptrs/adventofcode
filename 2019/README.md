# Advent of Code 2019

This is a quick-and-dirty implementation of all 2019 problems implemented in
Python because I got fed up with C++ and really couldn't stand the missing
stars on the [events page](https://adventofcode.com/2020/events).

I'll try to incorporate unit tests and all because it's just nice programming,
but this edition has decidedly less polish than my other attempts.
